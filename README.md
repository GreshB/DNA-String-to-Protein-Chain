# DNA-String-to-Protein-Chain
Program takes in a sequence of DNA and converts it to a protein chain. This program accounts for frame shifts as well. 
Currently it only returns 1 protein chain, however I am working to make it produce at least two. Secondly, if a dna sequence
that won't be able to create a protein chain is inputted, a message is printed to inform the user, however an error code 
is also produced along side it. It doesn't damage the program, or change how it would normally operate, just a minor
graphical annoyance

Note: The DNA strand must be 5' to 3', i.e. the coding strand

To start run `python file.py`
